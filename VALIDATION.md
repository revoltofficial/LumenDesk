# Validation record

Date: 13 October 2026. Status: source prototype, not a verified executable.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| App Info.plist syntax | Passed with macOS plutil |
| Build script syntax | Passed with zsh syntax check |
| Swift compilation | Blocked: invalid active developer path; xcrun missing |
| Six XCTest tests | Written, not run; same compiler blocker |
| Native interface rendering | Not run |
| Receiver/hardware output | Not run |
| ArtDMX field layout review | Compared with official specification; no wire capture |

Source review corrected the display universe range to 1–32768, mapped it to wire addresses 0–32767, made stage previews use rendered output, rejected duplicate IDs and overlapping channels, capped show-file loads, versioned the project schema, used monotonic time for fades, and let final dark packets drain before cancellation.

This review does not establish that the Swift source compiles. The sender is an ArtDMX unicast prototype: ArtPoll/subscriber discovery, bound source-port behavior, ArtPollReply handling, refresh negotiation, network recovery and full Art-Net controller conformance remain work items. The [official Art-Net specification](https://art-net.org.uk/downloads/art-net.pdf) requires subscription-aware transmission. A configured IP and correct packet bytes alone do not satisfy all controller requirements.

Before hardware use: compile/tests, inspect the native interface, receive packets on a simulator, verify byte order, sequencing, universe mapping and refresh rate, then verify blackout, cue interruption, destination changes, stopped output and receiver timeout behavior on a dedicated node.
